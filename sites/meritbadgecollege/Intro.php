			7.0.3.2 Group Instruction
			<br></br>
			It is acceptable—and sometimes desirable—for merit badges to be taught in group settings. This often occurs
			at camp and merit badge midways, fairs,
			clinics, or similar events, and even online through webinars. These can be efficient methods, and
			interactive group discussions can support learning.
			Group instruction can also be attractive to “guest experts” assisting registered and approved counselors.
			Slide shows, skits, demonstrations, panels,
			and various other techniques can also be employed, but as any teacher can attest, not everyone will learn
			all the material. Because of the importance of
			individual attention and personal learning in the merit badge program, group instruction should be focused
			on those scenarios where the benefits are
			compelling. There must be attention to each individual’s projects and fulfillment of all requirements. We
			must know that every Scout—actually and
			personally—completed them. If, for example, a requirement uses words like “show,” “demonstrate,” or
			“discuss,” then every Scout must do that. It is
			unacceptable to award badges on the basis of sitting in classrooms watching demonstrations, or remaining
			silent during discussions. It is sometimes reported
			that Scouts who have received merit badges through group instructional settings have not fulfilled all the
			requirements. To offer a quality merit badge program,
			council and district advancement committees should ensure the following are in place for all group
			instructional events. A culture is established for merit
			badge group instructional events that partial completions are acceptable expected results. A guide or
			information sheet is distributed in advance of events
			that promotes the acceptability of partials, explains how merit badges can be finished after events, lists
			merit badge rerequisites, and provides other helpful
			information that will establish realistic expectations for the number of merit badges that can be earned at
			an event.
			<br></br>
			Merit badge counselors are known to be registered and approved.
			<br></br>
			Any guest experts or guest speakers, or others assisting who are not registered and approved as merit badge
			counselors, do not accept the responsibilities of,
			or behave as, merit badge counselors, either at a group instructional event or at any other time. Their
			service is temporary, not ongoing.
			<br></br>
			Counselors agree to sign off only requirements that Scouts have actually and personally completed.
			<br></br>
			Counselors agree not to assume that stated rerequisites for an event have been completed without some level
			of evidence that the work has been done. Pictures
			and letters from other merit badge counselors or unit leaders are the best form of prerequisite
			documentation when the actual work done cannot be brought to the
			camp or site of the merit badge event.
			<br></br>
			There is a mechanism for unit leaders or others to report concerns to a council advancement committee on
			summer camp merit badge programs, group instructional
			events, and any other merit badge counseling issues— especially in instances where it is believed BSA
			procedures are not followed. See “Reporting Merit Badge
			Counseling Concerns,” 11.1.0.0.
			<br></br>
			Additional guidelines and best practices can be found in the Merit Badge Group Instruction Guide, developed
			by volunteers in conjunction with the National
			Advancement Program Team. This guide for units, districts, and councils includes several important event
			planning considerations as well as suggestions for
			evaluating the event after it is over to identify opportunities for improvement. The guide can be downloaded
			from
