    <h2>GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>The District Award of Merit is a council award presented by districts in the same manner that the Silver Beaver
        is a national
        award presented by councils.</p>
    <p>The award is available to Scouters who render service of an outstanding nature at the district level.</p>
    <p>The award is made available annually on the basis of 1 for each 25 traditional units or fraction thereof. The
        district need not
        present all the awards to which it is entitled each year.</p>
    <p>It is not appropriate to nominate a Scouter who has already received this award (Even if awarded by a different
        district/council).</p>
    <p>A professional Scouter or other council employee may not receive this award based on employment service. However,
        a professional
        Scouter or employee who also serves as a volunteer Scouter may be eligible, based on volunteer service.</p>
    </p>
    </br>
    <h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>
    <p>1. A nominee must be a registered Scouter.</p>
    <p>2. A nominee must have rendered noteworthy service to youth in Scouting, outside Scouting, or both.
        Note: The nature and value of “noteworthy service to youth” may consist of a single plan or decisions that
        contributed
        vitally to the lives of large numbers of youth or it may have been given to a small group over an extended
        period
        of time.</p>
    <p>3. Consideration must be given to the nominee’s Scouting position and the corresponding opportunity to render
        outstanding
        service beyond the expectations of that Scouting position.</p>
    <p>4. The nominee’s attitude toward and cooperation with the district and/or council is to be taken into
        consideration.</p>
    <p>5. Nominations cannot be considered for posthumous awards.</p>
