## Background

These tools support the **Centennial District** — a geographic and programmatic district within the **Greater Colorado Council** (Scouting Colorado), historically associated with the Denver Area Council. The district serves Scouts, units, and volunteers in the Denver metro / Aurora region and surrounding areas.

The sites focus primarily on **advancement support** and volunteer recognition rather than general unit or council information (which is typically found on scoutingcolorado.info or council main sites).

## Tech Notes (for maintainers)

- All sites appear to be lightweight PHP applications (index.php entry points).
- Likely using a simple shared backend or flat-file/database system for tracking Scouts, leaders, awards, Eagles, and merit badges.
- No public Git repository is known — contact district advancement/division chairs for source access if needed.
- Sites are functional and plain — focused on utility over modern design.

## How to Contribute or Get Help

- For Scout/parent/leader questions → contact your unit leader or the Centennial District Advancement Committee.
- For technical issues, award nomination problems, MBC counselor signup questions, or data updates → reach out via district channels (district commissioner, advancement chair, or Greater Colorado Council staff).
